We learnt what HTML and CSS are and how they are vital for web development.

We learnt about elements are their 2 major types : with closing tags and void elements that do not have a closing tag. 

Got to know a lot about different elements like <html>, <head>, <meta>, <body> and <h1> elements which all serve different purposes in a HTML file. 

There are 6 levels of headings ranging from h1 to h6 and they get less important from 1 to 6. There is also a paragraph tag called <p>. <strong> makes content inside it bold. <em> adds emphasis.
<!-- --> is a comment.

There are 2 lists. Unordered (<ul>) and ordered (<ol>) used for various purposes. 

We learnt about the anchor tag and how it works. How we can change different parameters like target and rel to change the behaviour of the link. We learnt how links work as well. 

We also added an image.


We finally created a project as well.
